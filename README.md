# INFO-H502-BaseBall

## Make baseball simulation in opengl
This project represents the implementation of an OpenGL simulation within the framework of the INFO-H502 Virtual Reality course. 
Our team has chosen to develop a Baseball simulation, offering an interesting experience where the player can actively engage by using a baseball bat to hit a dynamically moving ball. 
Through this endeavour, we aim to explore and apply the principles of virtual reality, leveraging OpenGL to create an interactive environment for users to enjoy.
Different features were implement for this project:

1. A shadow computation
2. A Particle system
3. Reflective object in cube map
4. Collision detection and physical engine
5. Frame buffer usage

The simulation contains a baseball bat that can be rotated by the user (with B and N), a ball that can be re-spawned at will (with V), a ground, light and a cube map environment.


## Launch
After building the CMakeList.txt, run the infoh502-cpp_main.exe.

## Play the game
To move the camera use "Z","Q","S","D" and "UP","DOWN,"RIGHT","LEFT" keyboard buttons.
To move the baseball bat use "B","N"  keyboard buttons.
To respawn the bat use the "V" keyboard buttons.
